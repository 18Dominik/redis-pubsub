# redis-pubsub

nodejs app with redis pub/sub

## Purpose
The app enables to set up a user in a frontend, save user name in redis database and publish a notification message via redis pub/sub to any subscriber. 

## Getting started
The app by default runs on port 3000.
### Set up redis

- Redis server: Start redis server via `docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis` for redis server: https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/ 
- Redis Client
    - VS Code extension: cweijan redis client (as of writing this, v1.2.5): Add the redis server via the left redis menu by clicking on the '+' sign.
    - Redis client for nodejs: To use Redis with Node.js, you need to install a Node.js Redis client via `npm install redis`

### start application
in the working directory: run `node app.js` 
### subscribe a server to reveive messages from redis pub/sub
in the subscribe directory: run `node server.js` in separate terminal
### redis cli 
#### Open 
open redis-cli when redis runs in docker container: run `docker exec -it DOCKERNAME redis-cli ` in separate terminal
#### Query examples
App.js
- A redis Set is initalized when entering the first user in the frontend. 
- Get all members of set: `smembers Users`


Set up Hash (key-field-value) "Weather": 
- `hset Weather 20220914 sunny`
- `hset Weather 20220915 cloudy`
- Retrieve the weather from 22.09.2014: `hget Wetter 20220914`

# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!).  Thank you to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README
Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Name
Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.
